Big, general issues

  1. Should we put in a 'composed of' section?

  2. Do we need the 'see also section?' Check that everything is in
  line for this.

  3. If so, look at the git history and review all the ones you
  previously deleted.



Specific issues

Vol 1

I. Add to glossary

1. odor
2. noun
3. tape
4. *
5. Subject
6. Need to document all odors
7. All of the vanes?
8. Face

II. Arms that need to be looked at (or have XX's)

  1. abel
  2. chum
  3. clue
  4. each
  5. edge
  6. manx, mane, mars, mart either have poor explanations, or
  none at all.
  7. tree
  8. port
  9. regex - example doesn't explicitly use regex
  10. rule
  11. trap, tyre, type, typo, vise (all need better examples)
  12. udal, udon, umph, urge, upas (all need better *explanations*)

III. Arms that have notes saying they should be moved

  1. wonk

To ++ut:

  1. limb
  2. metl
  3. port
  4. post,
  5. prop
  6. tiki
  7. toga

IV. Arms that there are notes to get rid of with '?'

  1. noun
  2. null
  3. numb
  4. tang
  5. tune

IV. Specific issues

  1. Don't understand how to explain qual, trel, pair, w/regard
  to using mold/type

  2. We need to explain with a %palm inside tank is. 

  3. Currently no explanations for mold, twig, and type. They
  have links to their own particular sections, which I don't
  think yet exist. How should we handle this?

  4. I think vase merits more of an explanation due to its
  importance.

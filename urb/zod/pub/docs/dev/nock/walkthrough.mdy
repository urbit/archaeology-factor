# Nock walkthrough

We'll walk through each line of the [Nock spec](../spec) and try
to explain it in plain English.  Of course, the spec itself is
the definition of Nock; this document is just an illustration.

## Lines 1-3: nouns

Nouns are Nock's data model: atoms and cells.

### 1: atoms
```
1  ::  An atom is a natural number.
```
By which is meant: an unsigned integer of any size.

Not only does Nock not limit the size of an atom, it harbors no
opinion at all on the atom's interpretation or presentation.

The atom `97` might mean the number `97`.  Or the number `0x31`.
Or the letter `a` (ASCII 97). A very large atom might be the
number of grains of sand on the beach - or it might be a GIF of
your children playing on the beach. 

> Other simple data types - signed integers, floating point, etc —
are easily mapped into atoms, although they are binary garbage
without external metadata.  But so is a Unix bytestream file, 
and this format has been 

### 2-3: cells
```
2  ::  A noun is an atom or a cell.
3  ::  A cell is an ordered pair of nouns.
```
In other words, a noun is a tree whose leaves are atoms.

> A noun is a pure tree.  Although any noun implementation
will be built with pointers, Nock can't create cyclical data 
structures: there is no Nock computation that can make a child 
that points back to its parent.  And while it's normal for noun 
implementations to share pointers, creating dag structure, 
there is no Nock computation that tests pointer equality.
The noun abstraction does not leak.

Although Nock specifies no syntax, we need a pseudocode to
specify Nock.  In this pseudocode, we group cells with
square brackets:
```
[1 1] 
[34 45] 
[[3 42] 12] 
[[1 0] [0 [1 99]]]
```
Brackets associate right.  That last noun is the same value as:
``` 
[[1 0] 0 1 99]
```
but it's okay to use unnecessary brackets for emphasis.

> A noun is a Lisp S-expression, except that (a) Nock defines no
noun syntax, and (b) Nock has no atom metadata.

> Nock is pair-oriented rather than list-oriented, and
noun syntaxes generally don't insert list terminators.  The Lisp
S-expression `(11 12 13)` is the Nock noun `[11 12 13 0]`.

## Lines 5-6: pseudocode
```
5  ::  nock(a)          *a
6  ::  [a b c]          [a [b c]]
```
Line 5 and 6 look like rules, but they're really pseudocode
syntax definitions.  Line 5 defines the `*` prefix operator as
Nock itself.  Line 6 tells us that brackets group right.

All further lines are actual reduction rules.  Each rule has two
pseudocode expressions: a "pattern", then a "production."

To reduce any pseudocode expression `x`, step downward from line
`8` to the first rule whose pattern matches `x`.  Every named
variable must match a noun in `x`.  Bind those variables into the
production, and reduce that expression.

Note that lines `10`, `14`, `21` and `39` produce their own
pattern.  This means Nock logically enters an infinite loop.  (A
practical interpreter will throw an exception.)  Mathematicians
call this "bottom."

## Lines 8-21: axiomatic operators

Besides `*`, the pseudocode defines four axiomatic operators on
nouns: `?` ("deep"), `+` ("bump"), `=` "same", and `/` ("find").

### 8-9: `?`, "deep"

The `?` operator tests if a noun is an atom or a cell.  Cells
produce `0`, atoms `1`.
```
8  ::  ?[a b]           0
9  ::  ?a               1
```
`0` in Nock is "yes," `1` is "no."  This is called a "loobean."
The motivation behind this decision is obscure.

### 10-11: `+`, "bump"

Bumping an atom produces that atom plus 1.  Bumping a cell
crashes.
```
10 ::  +[a b]           +[a b]
11 ::  +a               1 + a
```

### 12-14: `=`, "same"

A cell of two equal nouns produces `0`.  Any other cell produces
`1`.  An atom crashes.
```
12 ::  =[a a]           0
13 ::  =[a b]           1
14 ::  =a               =a
```

### 16-21: `/`, "seek"

Since a noun is a binary tree, we can address its subtrees with
atoms.  A tree address is called an "axis."

Axis `1` is the root.  At axis `n`, `2n` is the left child,
and `2n+1` is the right child.
```
16 ::  /[1 a]           a
17 ::  /[2 a b]         a
18 ::  /[3 a b]         b
19 ::  /[(a + a) b]     /[2 /[a b]]
20 ::  /[(a + a + 1) b] /[3 /[a b]]
21 ::  /a               /a
```
An illustrated axis tree:
```
         1
      2      3
    4   5  6   7
             14 15
```
A noun in which every leaf is its own axis:
```
[[4 5] [6 14 15]]
```

## Lines 23-39: Nock operator

The Nock operator is `*`.  A valid operand is always a cell
`[subject formula]`.  The "formula", always a cell, defines
the function to compute.  The "subject" is the input data.
The result of the computation is the "product."

### 23: "both"

If the head of a formula is a cell, the formula is a cell of two
formulas, `w` and `d`, where `w` is `[b c]`.  The product with 
subject `a` is `[x y]`, where `x` is `*[a w]` and `y` is `*[a d]`.
```
23 ::  *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]
```
> The "both" pattern only works because all *other* formulas are
cells whose head is an atom.  Otherwise, it would be ambiguous.
"both" is sometimes called "autocons", after the Lisp operator
*cons*, which also composes cells.

### 25: instruction `0`, "seek"

A formula whose head is `0` has a tail `b` which is an atom.
Its product with subject `a` is `/[b a]`, the noun at axis `b` in
`a`.
```
25 ::  *[a 0 b]         /[b a]
```
Intuitively, if the subject is an environment or scope, "seek"
retrieves a variable in that scope.

### 26: instruction `1`, "just"

A formula whose head is `1` has a tail `b` which is any noun.
Its product with subject `a` is `b`.
```
26 ::  *[a 1 b]         b
```
Intuitively, "just" produces a constant.

### 27: instruction `2`, "eval"

A formula whose head is `2` has a tail which is a cell `[b c]`.
Its product with subject `a` is `*[x y]`, where `x` is `*[a b]`
and `y` is `*[a c]`.
```
27 ::  *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]
```
Intuitively, evaluating a computed computation is the basis of
Turing-complete semantics in any interpreter.

### 28: instruction `3`, "deep"

A formula whose head is `3` has a tail which is a formula `b`.
Its product with subject `a` is `?[x]`, where `x` is `*[a b]`.
```
28 ::  *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
```
Intuitively, "deep" tests if a noun is an atom or a cell.

### 29: instruction `4`, "bump"

A formula whose head is `4` has a tail which is a formula `b`.
Its product with subject `a` is `+[x]`, where `x` is `*[a b]`.
```
29 ::  *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
```
Intuitively, "bump" increments an atom.

### 30: instruction `5`, "same"

A formula whose head is `5` has a tail which is a formula `b`.
Its product with subject `a` is `=[x]`, where `x` is `*[a b]`.
```
30 ::  *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]
```
Intuitively, "same" tests whether a cell is a pair of equal nouns.

### 32: instruction `6`, "pick"

A formula whose head is `6` has a tail which is three formulas,
`[b c d]`.  Where `x` is `*[a b]`, its product with subject `a` 
is `*[a c]` if `x` is `0`, and `*[a d]` if `x` is `1`.  If `x`
is neither `0` nor `1`, Nock crashes.
```
32 ::  *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
```
Intuitively, "pick" means "if `b`, then `c`, else `d`",
remembering that `0` is "yes" and `1` is "no".

> Lines 32-37 are "macros", defined only by formula expansions.
A Nock without macros would be just as powerful, but the code
would be less compact and efficient.  A good exercise is to trace
through the macros and see how they work.

### 33: instruction `7`, "link"

A formula whose head is `7` has a tail which is a cell `[b c]`,
where `b` and `c` are formulas.  Its product with subject `a` 
is `*[d c]`, where `d` is `*[a b]`.
```
33 ::  *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
```
Intuitively, "link" is the functional composition of `b` and `c`.

### 34: instruction `8`, "push"

A formula whose head is `8` has a tail which is a cell `[b c]`,
where `b` and `c` are formulas.  Its product with subject `a` 
is `*[[d a] c]`, where `d` is `*[a b]`.
```
34 ::  *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
```
Intuitively, "push" adds an intermediate computation to the
subject, rather like declaring a variable.

### 35: instruction `9`, "kick"

A formula whose head is `9` has a tail which is a cell `[b c]`,
where `b` is an atom and `c` is a formula.  Its product with
subject `a` is `*[d /[b d]]`, where `d` is `*[a c]`.
```
35 ::  *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
```
Intuitively, "kick" computes an internally defined function of a
complex noun containing both code and data, rather like calling
a method on an object.  `b` is the axis of a formula within `d`;
that formula is designed to use `d` as its subject.

### 36, 37: instruction `10`, "hint"

A formula whose head is `10` has a tail which is a cell `[e d]`,
where `d` is a formula, and `e` is either `[b c]` or `b`, where
`b` is an atom and `c` is a formula.  Its product with subject
`a` is always `*[a d]`, discarding `b`; but if there is a `c`,
`*[a c]` is computed then discarded.
```
36 ::  *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
37 ::  *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]
```
Intuitively, "hint" discards information.  A practical
interpreter can use this information without violating
the purity of the interpreter.  For example, one common hint is a
debug printf.  Any interpreter can perform any side effect as a
consequence of a hint; all still compute the same function.

> The complex form of "hint" exists because, if the hint discards
computed information, all interpreters must complete the
computation whether they apply the hint or not.  An interpreter
that skips the discarded computation, even if it has no way to
use the result, will erroneously fail to crash if the hint crashed.

### 39: default

Any computation not matching a previous pattern crashes.
```
39 ::  *a               *a
```
